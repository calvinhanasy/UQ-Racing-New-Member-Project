# UQ-Racing-New-Member-Project
As part of the UQ Racing New Member Project, I designed a compact, cost-effective PCB-based timing gate system to measure EV acceleration over 75 meters with 0.01s precision. Using an ESP32-WROOM32 microcontroller and a Ublox NEO-M9N GPS module, the system detects movement, logs real-time speed and timestamps, and communicates data via Wi-Fi or ESP-NOW. The GPS’s 25Hz refresh rate ensures accurate acceleration tracking, and the system is fully portable, housed in a slim acrylic case, and powered by the vehicle’s battery. External antennas were considered to improve signal reception while minimizing aerodynamic impact.

This project was my first real exposure to PCB design—from component selection and signal integrity to enclosure design. It was a hands-on, end-to-end experience that taught me how electrical systems are physically realized, and gave me the confidence to move from breadboards to fully assembled, functional PCBs. It marked an exciting and meaningful introduction into embedded systems design. Im exited to learn PCB design through my studies in the coming year.
